# Ghostbusters

The idea of this project is a spin on Ghostbusters. The player gets to choose between playing as a normal human or as a ghost. That choice will also apply for the enemy (human for player and enemy and the same for ghost). The game will take place in a city where the player will choose between two weapons. A gun where the number of bullets will be plenty or bombs where the rate of throws will be slow. If the player chooses to be human, he is vulnerable to every collision (including environmental obstacles). If the player chooses to be ghost, it will only be only vulnerable to enemy attacks. The enemy in human form will be shooting bullets at the player, and shooting laser if ghost form.
